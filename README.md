- 👋 Hi, I’m @martinabarletta
- 👀 I’m interested in NLP, in particular written documents analysis
- 🌱 I’m still a beginner in Python and I'm currently developing some codes for the E-CALM - SCOLEDIT project (hosted at University Grenoble Alpes) as an intern
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coreference resolution, NLP applied to learners corpora, how to modelize non-standard languages, comparing 'off-the-shelf' NLP tools
- 📫 How to reach me: martina.barletta@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr
